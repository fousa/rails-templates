MY RAILS TEMPLATES
==================

Ruby on Rails has a nice feature where you can generate a new rails project with a template.

My templates are based on the newest version of Rails at the moment: Rails 3.0.0beta

At the moment my templates handle:

- jQuery integration
- git
- git push to Github
- HAML integration
- HTTP basic authentication
- single password authentication

And here is how you generate a new rails app with my template:

    rails new_app -m http://github.com/fousa/rails-templates/raw/master/new.rb

And next just answer the questions!
